# FD Helper

**V 1.0**

* The `LOG TIME` button is added to the timer pop-up. When pressed, it automatically adds time to the input, so you just have to click `SAVE` to log the time.
* The pop-up closes when you press `ESC` or click outside it.
* Added the `show raw HTML` button - shows the text of the message/note in the "raw" form as it came to the FD. If there are attachments, they are attached to the bottom in the same pop-up.
* Added the `Show more` button when hovering over the ticket header - shows the last message from the ticket in full.

**V 0.7.1**

* The `note`, `edit`, `delete` buttons now also work with a timer. Everything that edits - runs the timer. Everything that deletes/sends - stops it.
* As a visualization, to make it easier to understand when the timer is running, and when it is not - you will see a line in the ticket. If it is red, the timer is on the stop. If it is green, it is running. This is done more for debugging and collecting feedback - how would you like the timer to work. I'll clean it up later.
* The alert has been replaced with a window in the middle of the screen.
* If you click on the time in the pop-up, it will be copied to the clipboard. But it is not necessary to do this because ...
* When you click on `Log time`, the time is automatically added to the input.
